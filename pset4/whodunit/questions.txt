1.  stdint.h is a header file that allows the use of fixed width integer types.
2.  The point of using fixed width integer types is to make sure that each type has always exactly the same size indepedently 
of the machine running the code. In this case, this is needed to represent the information contained on a BMP file on its first
53 bytes.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte; DWORD is 4 bytes; LONG is 4 bytes; WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  The first two bytes represent the type of the file. The BMP file starts with 'BM' in ASCII.
5.  bfSize is the size of the BMP file in bytes; biSize is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device indepedent Bitmap) and its origin is the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If the user has no permission to open the files or there is no more space to save the file; Besides, the fopen() function
gets a pointer so if one tries to dereference a NULL pointer a segmentation fault happens.
9.  The third argument of fread() indicates the quantity of RGBTRIPLE that it reads at a time (pixel by pixel).
10. 3
11. Allows one to rewind or fast-forward within a file.
12. SEEK_CUR - current position of the file pointer; to use with the fseek() function.
